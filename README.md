# Taboola reccomendation widgets

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to fetch data from the Taboola API
and display it in the form of widgets.
I used pure HTML, CSS and Javascript, with jest as my testing library, while
trying to keep my code clean and readable.

## Usage
To run the tests, simply run:
```javascript
npm i
npm run test

```
