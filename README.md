# Taboola recommendation widgets

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to fetch data from the Taboola API
and display it in the form of recommendation widgets.
I used pure HTML, CSS and Javascript, with jest as my testing library, while
keeping my code clean and readable.

## Usage
To run the project - use live-server.
To run the tests, simply run:
```javascript
npm i
npm run test

```
